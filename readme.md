Deployed at [here](https://pillarxyz-football-analytics-morocco-dashboard-4fob7a.streamlit.app/)

# TODO

- [ ] Visualizing changes of tactics
- [ ] Quantifying the impact of substitutions
- [ ] Calculating expected threat (xT) of passes
- [ ] Visualizing progressive passes
- [ ] Keep only events from game normal time, not penalties (penalties will be treated differently)
- [ ] Add comparative analysis between opposing teams
- [ ] Add documentation for each visualization and analysis
