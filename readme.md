# About

Dashboards for visualizing Morocco's 2022 World Cup Run using event data from each of their matches, though this can be extended to any match in any competition.



# TODO

- [ ] Visualizing changes of tactics
- [ ] Quantifying the impact of substitutions
- [ ] Calculating expected threat (xT) of passes
- [ ] Visualizing progressive passes
- [ ] Keep only events from game normal time, not penalties (penalties will be treated differently)
